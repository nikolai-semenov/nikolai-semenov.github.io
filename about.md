# Hi

I'm Nikolai. Currently I'm studying at MIPT and work as ML engineer.

# About this site

I created this blog to challenge my English and writing skills. However, Russian and German versions will be available soon. For now I'll try to fill it with (I hope) interesting articles about mathematics, computational physics, programming, machine learning, economics and other fascinating fields of study.
